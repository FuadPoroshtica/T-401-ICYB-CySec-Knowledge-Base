Follow these steps to upgrade to Notion’s Student Plus plan:

1. **Sign up or log in with your school email:** Use an email address ending in .edu or your institution’s domain (e.g., @ru.is)
2. **Verify your student status:** Notion will automatically detect if your email is from an eligible educational institution
3. **Apply for the upgrade:** Go to Settings & Members → Plans → Student Plan and click “Get Student Plan.”
4. **Wait for approval:** Verification is usually instant, but may take up to 24 hours in some cases
5. **Enjoy your benefits:** Once approved, your workspace will be upgraded to Plus with all the premium features

**Alternative verification methods:**

- If your school email doesn’t work automatically, you can verify through [Notion's student verification page](https://www.notion.so/students)
- You may need to provide additional documentation, like a student ID or enrollment letter

*Note: The Student Plus plan is free and renews annually as long as you maintain your student status.*
