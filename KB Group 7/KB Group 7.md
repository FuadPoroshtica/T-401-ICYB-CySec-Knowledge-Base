# KB Group 7

Hi everyone! 👋🏽

Welcome to Notion. You can get a student package deal for Plus, which is optional, but because of the file upload limit, it might be worth it.
And according to Notion:

[How to get Student Plus?](KB%20Group%207/How%20to%20Get%20Student%20Plus.md)

👉🏽 Notion Plus for students offers a free upgrade to the Plus Plan for individual workspaces when you sign in with a valid school email. This plan includes unlimited pages and blocks, unlimited file uploads, 30-day version history, and the ability to add up to 100 guests to your workspace. Students can organize plans, tasks, and notes across school and life with greater customization than the free plan offers. Student organizations at verified institutions also get a free Plus Plan with unlimited members, collaboration features, and the ability to invite guests.

Key features for students on the Plus Plan:

- Unlimited pages, blocks, and **file uploads**
- 30-day page edit history
- Up to 100 guests per workspace
- Enhanced customization, including site publishing options
- Free access with a school email
- For student organizations—unlimited members and complete collaboration tools

This plan is free for students and educators who verify their eligibility through their school email.

*Something to keep in mind,*
Regards,

Fuad 😊
