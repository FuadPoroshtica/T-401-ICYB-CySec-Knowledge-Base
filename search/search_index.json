A wiki (like Wikipedia) allows you to add as much information as you want without being constrained by a rigid folder hierarchy, since connections between concepts are handled through links and backlinks rather than through deep folder nesting. This matches the assignment goals of building a navigable, interlinked knowledge base of notes, terminology, tools, and resources.</p> <p>We initially started with Notion, a well-known collaborative Markdown-style editor with support for internal links. We chose it at first because:</p> <ul> <li>it works directly in the browser,</li> <li>it is easy to onboard new users,</li> <li>and we assumed we would have access to a free premium student tier.</li> </ul> <p>However, we eventually ran into its paywall, and continuing with our existing workspace would have required paying for additional seats ($120 in total). Instead of paying the fee, we exported our content and migrated to Obsidian, another popular Markdown-based, wiki-style editor.</p> <p>We chose Obsidian for the final version of the knowledge base because:</p> <ul> <li>It is completely free for personal and educational use.</li> <li>It works locally, so there are no surprises with quotas or paywalls.</li> <li>Its support for wikilinks (<code>Page name</code>, e.g., Side-Channel Attack).</li> <li>It integrates well with Git and GitHub, giving us proper version control and an easy way to share our work with instructors. Additionally, it lets us view it online during the final exam itself using GitHub\u2019s \u201cwiki\u201d feature.</li> <li>There is a large ecosystem of community plugins, which we could use if needed (though we mostly stuck to core features for this assignment).</li> </ul> <p>The main disadvantage of Obsidian compared to Notion is that it requires installing a desktop application and having some basic familiarity with Git. This has created a small learning curve for some group members, but it is currently quite straightforward and stable.</p>"},{"location":"#organization-overview","title":"Organization Overview","text":"<p>We organized our knowledge base using a relatively shallow folder structure and relied heavily on Obsidian\u2019s internal links and search to connect related topics. This allowed us to keep the system flexible while still satisfying the assignment requirements.</p> <p>The top-level structure is:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>/Lecture notes/</code></p> <ul> <li>Contains collaboratively written notes for each lecture. Each file corresponds to a specific lecture date or topic. Inside these notes we:<ul> <li>summarize key concepts and definitions,</li> <li>highlight important takeaways,</li> <li>link to terminology entries and tools mentioned in the lecture,</li> <li>and occasionally add diagrams or code snippets when they help clarify an idea.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>/Terminology/</code></p> <ul> <li>Contains our glossary of cyber security terms. Entries are loosely grouped by topic (e.g., networking, web security, operating system security) but we intentionally kept the folder structure simple. Each glossary note typically includes:<ul> <li>a definition,</li> <li>context or examples,</li> <li>related terms (linked via Obsidian wikilinks),</li> <li>and sometimes links to external resources or relevant tools.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>/Resources/</code>     TODO</p> </li> <li> <p><code>/Tools and Commands/</code></p> <ul> <li>A compendium of security tools and common commands, grouped by purpose (e.g., scanning, log analysis, forensics, etc.). For each tool or command we try to include:<ul> <li>a short description of what it does,</li> <li>example usage,</li> <li>typical operating system(s),</li> <li>and a link to official documentation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Although these folders exist, we did not want the folder hierarchy to become a bottleneck. Instead, we relied on:</p> <ul> <li>consistent naming conventions (e.g., <code>Lecture YYYY-MM-DD Topic</code>, <code>Term \u2013 XYZ</code>),</li> <li>and Obsidian\u2019s graph/backlinks view.</li> </ul> <p>This approach let us quickly jump from a lecture note to the relevant glossary term, see all tools associated with a particular topic, and keep the knowledge base usable even as it grew.</p>"},{"location":"#collaborative-process-reflection","title":"Collaborative Process Reflection","text":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/2025-11-24%20Introduction%20%28G%C3%ADsli%29/","title":"2025-11-24 Introduction (G\u00edsli)","text":"<p>(24.11.2025 W1 Monday 09:00)</p>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/2025-11-24%20Introduction%20%28G%C3%ADsli%29/#course-overview","title":"Course overview","text":""},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/2025-11-24%20Introduction%20%28G%C3%ADsli%29/#course-contents","title":"Course contents:","text":"<ul> <li>Linux + Windows CLI tools.</li> <li>OS basics (access control).</li> <li>Networking basics.</li> <li>Virtualization.<ul> <li>Some of the labs we\u2019ll be doing will be on virtual machines and stuff.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Web security.</li> <li>Common tools for security testing.</li> <li>Principles of defense.</li> <li>Guest lectures on various topics: phishing, information warfare, binary exploitation, maybe more topics.

People are constantly targeted by phishing attacks, which are becoming more sophisticated with the help of AI and Machine Learning. Every year, new phishing attacks are created, and many of them evade traditional detection methods. PhishTank is a popular repository of phishing websites, a popular resource for researchers and practitioners to get data about phishing websites. It\u2019s an up-to-date list of phishing URLs. (https://phishtank.org/) These blocklists are integrated into various production systems to help protect users from phishing attacks. So you really can\u2019t afford to make a mistake when building these systems. Question: How do you think such blocklists are kept up to date? Answer: They are often updated via user submissions, but mostly by automated detection systems. They use crawlers (and ML?) to find new phishing websites.

This is part of the reason why IPv4 is still widely used despite the exhaustion of available addresses, and why the switch to IPv6 has been slow. Cons: - Breaks end-to-end connectivity: Some applications and protocols that rely on direct peer-to-peer connections may not work properly behind a NAT.     - Peer-to-peer applications are when you connect directly to another user\u2019s device, rather than going through a central server. Examples include file-sharing applications, VoIP services, and sometimes online gaming.     - Examples of workarounds are things like STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), which help establish connections between devices behind NATs. - Loss of attribution: It can be difficult to trace the origin of traffic, which can complicate logging and monitoring.</p> <p>[!warning] NAT is not a security feature.

The Morris Worm automatically spread across the Internet by exploiting vulnerabilities in UNIX operating systems. Once inside a machine, it copied itself repeatedly due to a flaw in its design, overloading systems. 2. Around 6000 computers which was roughly 10% of the internet at the time, became unusable as the worm slowed or crashed systems.\u201dSome institutions scrapped and replaced their systems, while others went offline for up to a week.  \u201cThe worm did not damage or destroy files, but it still packed a punch,\u201d says an FBI case study of the event. 3.

The attackers initially gained access through Phishing email with a malicious attachments containing the malware, giving them a Backdoor into the utility\u2019s IT network. Over months they, compromised credentials and escalated privileges, ultimately reaching the control (SCADA) network that manages the grid operations. On December 23, they took control of operator workstations, opened circuit breakers at around 30, taking them all offline and causing the power outage. They disabled backup power and remote\u2011control functions, they also deployed KillDisk to erase utility systems and launched a telephone denial\u2011of\u2011service attack against customer call\u2011centers to hinder outage reporting. 2. The power outage effected around 225,000 Ukrainian customers, the first publicly acknowledged blackout caused by a cyberattack. Although electricity was restored within hours, the event demonstrated that a cyberattack could disrupt critical infrastructure beyond data theft, marking a historic warning for global grid operators. 3. The attackers exploited human network weaknesses (spear\u2011phishing to install malware), insufficient network segregation (allowing lateral movement from IT to SCADA systems), weak credential security, and lack of robust defense mechanisms preventing remote takeover of control\u2011system workstations and breaker controls.</p> <p>WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017) (WannaCry is an example of crypto Ransomware, a type of malware used to extort money.

The attack infected PCs and spread automatically between connected machines by itself without requiring user intervention or social engineering. It encrypted the user\u2019s files and displayed a ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin. 2.

It uses the EternalBlue exploit to spread between connected systems that where not patched against the Vulnerability. https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/wannacry-ransomware-attack (EternalBlue, a Zero-Day Vulnerability in devices that use an old version of SMB. It exploits a vulnerability in the Microsoft implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. This dupes a Windows machine that has not been patched against the vulnerability into allowing illegitimate data packets into the legitimate network. These data packets can contain malware such as a Trojan, ransomware or similar dangerous program.)</p> <p>Day 2- Virtualization</p> <ol> <li> <p>Under what specific scenarios would you have to choose VMs over containers for security reasons, and vice-versa? VM are better if security is the priority since each VM operates as a fully isolated computer with its own OS and applications, so if one VM is compromised, it\u2019s difficult for the attack to spread to other VMs or the host machine. But containers share the host operating system kernel, so a vulnerability in the kernel can potentially affect all containers. So VMs are better suited for workloads that handle sensitive data or require strict security and compliance. Containers might be chosen when performance is the priority as containers are faster, lighter, and more resource efficient, the fast startup time of containers directly contributes to scalability, making them ideal for microservices architectures. https://monovm.com/blog/vm-vs-containers/</p> </li> <li> <p>Research historical examples of VM Escape vulnerabilities (e.g., specific CVEs for VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, or Docker).

Find examples of vulnerabilities and attacks using Bluetooth:     1. PerfektBlue (2024-2025): This recent vulnerability chain affects millions of vehicles through OpenSynergy's BlueSDK, enabling remote code execution over Bluetooth Classic with minimal user interaction.  Attackers within Bluetooth range can compromise infotainment systems to access GPS location, microphones, and contact lists.      2. KNOB Attack (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth): This exploit forces devices to agree on encryption keys with significantly reduced entropy during the pairing process, making brute-force attacks feasible. The vulnerability exists because the key negotiation itself isn't encrypted.    3. BLUFFS Attack (CVE-2023-24023): Six attacks that break forward and future secrecy guarantees in Bluetooth, allowing adversaries-in-the-middle to compromise one session key and reuse it across multiple sessions. This affects Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2 to 5.4. 3. Why Bluetooth is a terrible protocol?    1. Complex Protocol Stack: Bluetooth stacks handle large volumes of untrusted data through multi-layer protocols like L2CAP, RFCOMM, and AVRCP, largely implemented in C, combining memory safety risks with complex state handling.    2. Legacy Issues: Legacy bugs often persist in modern systems for years, and many vulnerabilities are logic-based and difficult to detect using traditional testing methods.    3. Default Insecure Configurations: Many devices ship with Bluetooth in discoverable mode or use weak default PINs, and developers often use insecure examples from SDKs without implementing proper security features.    4. Default Insecure Configurations: Many devices ship with Bluetooth in discoverable mode or use weak default PINs, and developers often use insecure examples from SDKs without implementing proper security features. 5. What is the best protection against Bluetooth attacks? Primary Defense: The simplest and most effective way to block attacks is to turn off Bluetooth whenever you don't need it.    Additional Protections:    1. Disable Discovery Mode: Ensure devices are set to non-discoverable mode when not actively pairing.    2. Keep Firmware Updated: Regular updates patch known vulnerabilities.    3. Use Strong Authentication: Avoid default PINs like \"0000\" or \"1234\"    4. Reject Unknown Connections: Never accept pairing requests from unrecognized devices    5. Avoid Public Pairing: Don't pair devices in public spaces where attackers may be scanning    6. Use Encryption: Enable Bluetooth encryption when available    7. Remove Old Pairings: Delete unused or untrusted device pairings    8. For Organizations: Implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies to control Bluetooth settings 7. What individuals and organizations can do prevent or defend against attacks that use Rogue Access Points?    What Are Rogue Access Points? Unauthorized wireless access points installed on a secure network without administrator authorization. Evil twins are a specific type where hackers create fake Wi-Fi that mimics legitimate networks.    Individual Defenses:    1. Use a VPN - Your strongest defense. Even if you connect to a rogue AP, VPN encryption prevents hackers from reading your traffic.    2. Verify Networks - Check that the SSID matches what the venue provides and look for duplicate network names. Ask staff when uncertain.    3. Disable Auto-Connect - Regularly clear saved Wi-Fi networks so your device doesn't automatically connect to evil twins using familiar names.    4. Use HTTPS - Stick to websites with the padlock icon, which encrypt communication.    5. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication - Requires extra verification beyond passwords, protecting accounts even if credentials are stolen.    6. Avoid Sensitive Activities on Public Wi-Fi - Use mobile data for banking or wait until you're on a trusted network.    Organization Defenses    1. Deploy WIDS/WIPS - Systems that scan Wi-Fi frequencies to detect unauthorized access points and can automatically block connections to them.    2. Network Segmentation - Divide networks into VLANs so a breach in one segment doesn't grant access to everything    3. Strong Authentication - Use WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise with 802.1X and RADIUS for secure authentication.    4. Regular Audits - Regularly scan for unauthorized access points through automated and manual checks.    5. Physical Security - Limit physical access to network hardware to prevent direct connection of rogue devices.    6. Employee Education - Train staff on risks of unauthorized devices and enforce strict policies about personal routers.    7. Zero Trust Architecture - Treat all users and devices as untrusted until authenticated and authorized.</p> <p>Day 9 - AI Security AI Security 1. The 2024 Hong Kong Deepfake Scam.    - What happened? In early February 2024, Hong Kong police reported a case where deepfake techology was employed to execute a multimillion-dollar fraud. The scammers orchestrated a video conference call, using deepfakes to impersonate the chief financial offier and other staff members of the mutlinational firm Arup, convincing a finance worker to transfer approximately 25 million dollars to five Hong Kong bank accounts.    - In general how can cases like these be prevented? These cases can be prevented be implementing stronger verification methods beyond visual confirmation, sucha as multi-factor authentication or independent confirmation of requests, as well as training for employees on recognizing deepfake technology and understanding the tactics used in such scams can help employees remain vigilant.    - What are security risks that come with the existence (and easy creation) of Deepfakes for:      - Individuals? Enabling impersonations of people and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, they can lead to reputational damage and privacy violations by creating misleading or harmful content that appears real.      - Organizations?  Enabling impersonation executives, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and financial fraud. They can also damage an organization's reputation and undermine trust, making it essential for companies to implement detection technologies and response plans.      - Society as a whole? Enabling misinformation, identity theft, and manipulation of public opinion, particularly during elections or crises. Their realistic nature can undermine trust in genuine media, making it difficult for individuals to discern truth from falsehoods, which can lead to broader societal consequences.      - Keywords: Identity theft, fraud, undermining of democracy, misinformation.   </p> <p>Day 11 - Defense Defense 1. What replaces the Firewall as a primary enforcement point in Zero Point?    Instead of relying on a traditional perimeter firewall/VPN, Google uses context-aware access proxies and a centralized Access Control Engine that authenticate and authorize every request based on user identity and device trust, not network location. 2. How does a system decide if a device is trusted?    Trust is determined dynamically using a Trust Inferer that evaluates multiple device and user attributes such as:    - Device state (patch level, antivirus, encryption, certificates)    - Whether the device is managed/registered    - User identity and role    - Contextual signals (location, time, behavior)   Based on these, a trust level or tier is assigned, which dictates what resources the device can access.  3. What are advantages and disadvantages of this approach regarding security?    Advantages:    - No trusted network perimeter \u2014 all access is verified per request, reducing implicit trust.    - Granular, context-aware access control \u2014 decisions based on identity &amp; device posture, not IP or location.    - Least-privilege enforcement \u2014 devices/users get only what they need.    - Improved protection against lateral movement \u2014 attackers can\u2019t exploit broad network access.    Disadvantages:    - Complexity &amp; cost \u2014 implementing continuous verification and trust inference requires major architectural changes.    - Operational overhead \u2014 needs continuous monitoring of devices and identities.    - Dependency on backend systems \u2014 if access proxies or identity services fail, user access and productivity are impacted.    - Policy management difficulty \u2014 creating and maintaining fine-grained rules takes effort. 4. Quick summary of how Google replaced VPN and traditional firewalls    Traditional model: If you\u2019re on the corporate network (inside firewall + VPN), you\u2019re trusted and get broad access. Google\u2019s Zero Trust (BeyondCorp):    - No special trusted network \u2014 whether you\u2019re on-site or remote, all access is treated as coming from an untrusted network.    - Authentication &amp; authorization happen on every request through an access proxy using device identity + user credentials + context.    - Firewall/VPN are not primary defense points \u2014 enforcement is done by access proxies and policy engines that verify trust continuously. </p>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/IntroToCySec-Hreimur/","title":"IntroToCySec-Hreimur","text":""},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/IntroToCySec-Hreimur/#cyber-defense","title":"Cyber Defense","text":"<p>Attack surfaces, basically everything that has any form of input or control over software or machine, example: Email, networks, usb, sms, software dists and downloads Computer security involves: preventing and detecting unwanted acces, use of computer and theft of data and prevention of unauthorized modifications and or injection of data catagories include unauth access, modification, and disclosure denial of auth access forgery, repudiation - -rep basically, spoofing - fakes being a legit entity Evolution of computer security prevent attacks with better programing and design quality and test dawg Extra Reading </p>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/IntroToCySec-Hreimur/#creeper-1971","title":"Creeper (1971)","text":"<p>How it worked?

Operates at different privilege levels: Usermode (Ring 3), Kernel mode (Ring 0), Hypervisor (Ring -1). Modifies system files, alters system calls, and uses stealth techniques to evade detection. Can hide files, processes, network connections, and registry keys from users and security software. Famous historical Examples: Sony BMG Rootkit Scandal (2005) What happened? Sony BMG secretly installed rootkit DRM software on 22+ million music CDs. How it worked? When CDs played on windows PCs rootkit installed automatically without user consent to prevent copying. Security Impact? Hid files starting with \"sys\" from users and antivirus, Created vulnerabilities exploited by other malware, Slowed computers and made them susceptible to attacks. Consequences: Class action lawsuits, CD recalls, FTC settlement, US-CERT advisory, massive PR disaster Detection Challenges: Rootkits subvert detection software by controlling what the system reports. Specialized anti rootkit tools required (signature scanning, difference-based detection, memory dump analysis) Best detection: Boot from trusted OS or use hardware based analysis #### Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities Core Concept Speculative execution: Modern CPUs use speculative execution for performance optimization: CPU predicts which code branch will execute and runs it before knowing if the prediction is correct. If wrong results discarded - but side effects remain in CPU cache. Attackers exploit these side effects using cache timing attacks to steal data Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) What it exploits? Out-of-order execution + permission check timing issue. Intel processors check permissions after reading memory (speculative execution). Data brought into cache before CPU realizes user shouldnt acces it Attack mechanism: 1. User process tries to read kernel memory (forbiden) 2. CPU reads memory speculatively BEFORE checking permissions. 3. Data loaded into cache. 4. Permission check fails, instruction discarded. 5. BUT data remains in cache - attacker measures cache timing to extract it. Impact: breaks fundemental isolation between user applications and OS. Allows reading all system memory including passwords, encryption keys, sensitive data. Affects virtually all Intel x86 processors (1995-present) and some ARM processors Mitigation: KPTI (Kernel Page Trable Isolation) - formerly KAISER. Separates kernel and user virtual address space. Removes kernel memory from page tables when user code runs. Performance cost: Extra work during system class (~5-30% slowdown) #### DMA (Direct Memory Access) Attacks What is DMA? feature allowing hardware devices to access system memory directly without CPU involvement. Used by GPUs, NIC, storage devices, peripherals for high speed data transfer. Security problem: Bypasses OS security, MMU and virtual memory protections. Attack Concept Normal access: Applications &gt; OS &gt; CPU &gt; Memory. DMA attack: Malicious device &gt; Physical memory bypassing all OS security. Attack Vectors: Physical access attacks: Thunderbolt, FireWire, ExpressCard, PCIe ports provide DMA capability. Attacker connects rogue device to DMA enabled port. Device reads/writes system memory directly. Can steal encryption keys, install malware, bypass login screens. \"EVIL MAID\" Attack scenario: Brief physical access to victim laptop (hotel room, airport). Connect DMA attack device via thunderbolt. Extract passwords encryption keys from RAM. Install persistent backdoor. All within minutes, systems appears untouched. Remote/Network DMA: RDMA (Remote direct memory access): Used in data centers for performance. Attacker compromises network device (NIC) firmware. Performs DMA attacks over network without physical access. Throwhammer: Triggers Rowhammer bit flips remotely via network packets. Mitigation Strategies: Hardware level: IOMMU (I/O Memory Management Unit) Maps device memory access through virtual addresses. Limits Memory ranges DMA devices can access. Not foolproof - Thunderspy bypasses some IOMMU protections. Firmware/bios OS Settings Physical security Best practices: remove unnecessary SUID permission from binaries. Never allow thunderbolt devices from untrusted sources. Enterprise: require user authentication for DMA capable connections. Data center: Isolate RDMA traffic, monitor for anomalies. Key Takeaway: DMA attacks remain viable in todays age despite vendor protections. Evil maid scenarios, compromised firmware, and remote RDMA attacks make this relevant for enterprise security. #### SUID Bit Mitigation Techniques Common SUID explot techniques: Command execution binaries like find, vim, nano, less, more, awk, sed exploited by using built in shell execution features: <pre><code>find . -exec /bin/bash -p \\; # spawns root shell\nvim -c ':!/bin/bash'\n</code></pre> File Read/Write binaries: cp, mv, cat, tail, head exploit by overwriting sensitive system files <pre><code># if cp has SUID bit:\ncp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd # copy for editing\necho 'attacker::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' &gt;&gt; /tmp/passwd\ncp /tmp/passwd /etc/passwd # Overwrite original - now were root!\n</code></pre> PATH Variable Manipulation: If SUID program calls other programs without absolute paths. Exploit: Create malicious version in /tmp,modify $PATH <pre><code>echo '/bin/bash' &gt; /tmp/ls\nchmod +x /tmp/ls\nexport PATH=/tmp:$PATH\n./vulnerable_suid_program # Execuites /tmp/ls instead of /bin/ls\n</code></pre> Symlink Attacks: If SUID program writes to user-controllable file. Exploit: Replace destination with symlink to /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow <pre><code>ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/target_file\n./vulnerable_suid_program /tmp/target_file # writes to /etc/passwd\n</code></pre> Mitigation Strats Find all SUID and SGID binaries and compare to baseline and remove all custom SUID binaries if not necessary. Remove unneccessary SUID permissions. Use Linux capabilities instead, More fine grained than SUID, If compromised attacker only gets that ONE capability not full root. Nice Notes Rootkits hide at kernel level: detection requires specialized tools, trusted OS or hardware analysis. Stuxnet was first cyberweapon causing physical damage via rootkit. Sony BMG scandal exposed 22m users to security risks with DRM rootkit. Meltdown breaks OS kernel isolation - All intel CPUs vulnerable fixed by KPTI. Spectre harder to fix nearly universal CPU vulnerability, partial mitigations only. Speculative execution side effect leak data through cahce timing. DMA bypasses all OS security direct physical memory access. PCILeech is primary DMA attack tool (Thunderbolt/PCIe). Thunderspy breaks thunderbolt 3 security on all 2011-2020 systems. IOMMU provides DMA protection but not fool proof. SUDI mitigation remove unnecessary, use capabilities, audit regularly, monitor execution. Never give SUID to: cp, find, vim or any command execution binaries."},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/","title":"Virtualization-Hreimur","text":""},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/#key-ideas","title":"Key Ideas","text":"<p>Abstract physical resources allowing them to shared or replicated in software  Like a big apartment building (physical server) and individual apartments (virtual machines) each got their own stuff going on but share the same underlying structure </p>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/#purpose","title":"Purpose","text":"<ul> <li>Resource Util: maximize the usage of expensive hardware</li> <li>Cost Saving: Reduces power usage, cooling, data center space and hardware purchases</li> <li>Flexibility: just start up a new vm instead of deploying new physical hardware</li> <li>Isolation and Security: VMs are isolated from each other preventing issues in one affecting the rest</li> <li>Business continuity and disaster recovery: Easier to backup, replicate and restore systems </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/#comon-uses","title":"Comon Uses","text":"<ul> <li>Running dozens of virtual server on a single pyhsical server</li> <li>Quickly spinning upp VMs for testing software without affecting production systems</li> <li>Foundation for services like AWS EC2, Azure VMs and Google Cloud compute engine</li> <li>Virtual desktop for users, allowing access from anywhere</li> <li>Replicating and restoring entire virtualized environments</li> <li>Runnig older OS or apps that require specific hardware/environments</li> <li>Safely run untrusted apps or browsing the web in an isolated environment </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/#terms","title":"Terms","text":"<ul> <li>Host/OS: The physicial computer</li> <li>Guest: the software based computer that runs on the host, has its own virtual hardware</li> <li>Hypervisor: The software that creates, runs and manages the virtual machine, acts as a mediator between host and guest </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/#types-of-hypervisors","title":"Types of hypervisors","text":"<ul> <li>Type 1: runs directly on the host hardware without underlying OS,<ul> <li>Pros: High performance, greater security and enterprise grade</li> <li>Examples like VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-v and KVM</li> </ul> </li> <li>Type 2: Runs as an application on top of the host OS<ul> <li>Pros: Easy setup, good for desktop development/testing</li> <li>Example: Virtualbox, VMware</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/Virtualization-Hreimur/#virtualization-methods","title":"Virtualization Methods","text":"<ul> <li>Full Virtualization: Fully simulates hardware, guet OS runs unmodified<ul> <li>How it works: Hypervisor fully simulates all hardware for the guest OS.
