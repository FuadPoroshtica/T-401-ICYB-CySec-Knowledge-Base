# Threat Analysis

Threat analysis is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing potential threats to an organization’s assets and operations.

## Threat Modeling

### What is Threat Modeling?
A structured approach to identifying and addressing potential security threats during the design phase.

### Common Methodologies

#### STRIDE
Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE categorizes threats:
- **S**poofing - Pretending to be someone else
- **T**ampering - Modifying data or code
- **R**epudiation - Denying actions performed
- **I**nformation Disclosure - Exposing information
- **D**enial of Service - Making systems unavailable
- **E**levation of Privilege - Gaining unauthorized access

#### DREAD
Risk assessment model:
- **D**amage potential
- **R**eproducibility
- **E**xploitability
- **A**ffected users
- **D**iscoverability

#### PASTA
Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis:
1. Define objectives
2. Define technical scope
3. Application decomposition
4. Threat analysis
5. Vulnerability analysis
6. Attack enumeration
7. Risk and impact analysis

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Calculation
**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

### Risk Assessment Frameworks
- NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
- OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)

## Common Attack Vectors

### Network-Based Attacks
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- DNS Spoofing
- ARP Poisoning
- DDoS Attacks

### Application-Based Attacks
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)

### Social Engineering
- Phishing
- Spear Phishing
- Pretexting
- Baiting

## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Lifecycle
1. Discovery
2. Reporting
3. Assessment
4. Remediation
5. Verification
6. Documentation

### Tools
- Vulnerability scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS)
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
