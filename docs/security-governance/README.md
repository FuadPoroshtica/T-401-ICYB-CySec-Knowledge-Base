# Security Governance

Security governance establishes the framework for managing and overseeing an organization's information security program.

## Security Policies

### Types of Policies
- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**: Defines acceptable use of IT resources
- **Access Control Policy**: Governs user access to systems and data
- **Data Classification Policy**: Categorizes data by sensitivity
- **Password Policy**: Sets requirements for password creation and management
- **Incident Response Policy**: Outlines procedures for handling security incidents

### Policy Development Process
1. Identify requirements and objectives
2. Draft policy content
3. Review with stakeholders
4. Obtain management approval
5. Communicate and train
6. Implement and enforce
7. Review and update regularly

## Compliance Frameworks

### ISO 27001
International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).

**Key Requirements:**
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Security policy documentation
- Organization of information security
- Human resource security
- Physical and environmental security
- Operations security

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Five core functions:
1. **Identify**: Asset management, risk assessment
2. **Protect**: Access control, awareness training
3. **Detect**: Anomaly detection, continuous monitoring
4. **Respond**: Response planning, communications
5. **Recover**: Recovery planning, improvements

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
EU regulation for data protection and privacy.

**Key Principles:**
- Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality
- Accountability

### Other Frameworks
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
- CIS Controls

## Security Awareness Training

### Training Topics
- Phishing recognition
- Password security
- Social engineering
- Safe browsing practices
- Mobile device security
- Data handling procedures

### Training Methods
- Online courses
- Simulated phishing exercises
- In-person workshops
- Security newsletters
- Tabletop exercises

## Security Audits and Assessments

### Types of Assessments
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifies system weaknesses
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulates real-world attacks
- **Security Audit**: Reviews compliance with policies
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential threats and impacts

### Audit Process
1. Planning and scoping
2. Information gathering
3. Vulnerability analysis
4. Exploitation (if penetration test)
5. Reporting
6. Remediation verification

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Number of security incidents
- Patch compliance rate
- Security training completion rate
- Vulnerability remediation time
