# Network Security

Network security encompasses the policies, practices, and technologies designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility of computer networks and data.

## Key Concepts

### Firewalls
Firewalls act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

**Types of Firewalls:**
- Packet-filtering firewalls
- Stateful inspection firewalls
- Application-layer firewalls
- Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)

### Network Segmentation
Network segmentation divides a computer network into smaller parts to improve security and performance.

**Benefits:**
- Limits the spread of attacks
- Reduces the attack surface
- Improves network performance
- Simplifies compliance

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- **IDS**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators
- **IPS**: Monitors and can take action to prevent detected threats

### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
VPNs create secure, encrypted connections over less secure networks, such as the public internet.

**Common VPN Protocols:**
- OpenVPN
- IPSec
- WireGuard
- L2TP/IPSec

## Best Practices

1. Implement defense in depth
2. Regularly update and patch systems
3. Monitor network traffic continuously
4. Implement the principle of least privilege
5. Conduct regular security assessments
