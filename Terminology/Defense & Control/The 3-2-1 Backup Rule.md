# The 3-2-1 Backup Rule
[Ransomware](../Attacks/Malware/Ransomware.md) targets backups first, so having multiple backups is important. Don’t keep a backup just on your computer.

> [!info] The 3-2-1 rule.
> - **3** copies of data.
> - **2** Different media types (e.g., disk + tape/cloud)
> - **1** Copy offline (physically separated)

**Immutable backups:** Backups that cannot be altered or deleted, even by an administrator, for a set period.
