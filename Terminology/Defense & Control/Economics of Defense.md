# Economics of Defense 💰🛡️
- One of the problems of defense is that cyber warfare is asymmetric. The attacker only needs to find *one flaw*, but the defender needs to fix all of them.
- **The goal:** The CIA triad: 🔺
	- **Confidentiality:** Information is not disclosed to unauthorized parties.
    - **Integrity:** Information is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized
      manner.
    - **Availability:** Information is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity.

## Security vs Usability: ⚖️💻
- The *most secure* computer is unplugged, buried in concrete, and guarded by sharks.
- *Problem*: it is useless, completely unusable.
- The easiest way to make something secure is to make it completely unusable.

Security measures must be **psychologically acceptable**. If security is too hard, users will bypass it.

- *Example:* You can make your users have a super complicated password that’s really hard to crack, like `æjalsASDJFOASDIF439II)/)(#d`, but instead of memorizing it the user will probably just write it on a sticky note.
 

We do not *eliminate* risk, we *manage* it. ⚠️

$\text{Risk} = \text{Threat} \times \text{Vulnerability} \times \text{Cost}$.

- **Threat:** Who wants to attack us? *What* is the threat?
- **Vulnerability:** How easy is it to attack us? How *vulnerable* are we?
- **Cost:** What is the cost of the attack? What do we lose?
- (Threat × Vulnerability = is the likelihood of an attack happening.)
With countermeasures, we can address the vulnerability part. But we can also reduce the cost (impact), like having backups and having a plan for how we respond.

Mitigation is not the only option when facing a risk:

- **Mitigate/reduce:** Reduce likelihood or impact to an acceptable level.
- **Avoid:** Discontinue the activity that generates the risk. (E.g., we will not store credit card info, so we avoid the risk of leaking it.)
- **Accept:** The cost of the fix > impact of the risk. (E.g., small website that gets few visitors, so we accept the risk of DDoS.)
- **Transfer:** Move risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).

## Cost-benefit analysis 📊⚖️

Do a cost-benefit analysis when deciding on countermeasures.

> [!example]
> You do not buy a $5,000 titanium lock to secure a $50 bike.

Defense cost must not exceed the value of what is being protected.

**[Defense in Depth](Defense%20in%20Depth.md):** Multiple layers of defense, so if one fails, others are still there.
