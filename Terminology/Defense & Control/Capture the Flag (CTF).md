# CTF🏁
A CTF (Capture The Flag) is a security competition where participants solve challenges to find “flags” (secret strings) hidden in the challenges. They are a great way to practice and learn cybersecurity skills.

The format:
- Jeopardy-style: Solve challenges in various categories (e.g., web, crypto, forensics, reverse engineering).
- Attack-defense: Teams attack each other’s systems while defending their own.

*CTFs are gamified learning.*
