# Castle and Moat security model

The **Castle and Moat security model** is a traditional cybersecurity concept that likens an organization’s security infrastructure to a medieval castle surrounded by a moat. In this model, the “castle” represents the internal network or system that needs protection, while the “moat” symbolizes the defensive measures put in place to prevent unauthorized access.

The primary idea behind the Castle and Moat model is to create a strong perimeter defense that keeps threats out. This is typically achieved through various security measures such as [Firewalls](<./Firewall.md>), intrusion detection systems, and [Access Controls](Access Control.md). The moat serves as a barrier that deters attackers from reaching the castle, much like how a physical moat would deter invaders from breaching a fortress.

## Limitations

However, the Castle and Moat model has its limitations. It assumes that threats primarily come from outside the network, which can lead to complacency regarding internal threats. Once an attacker breaches the moat, they may have relatively unrestricted access to the castle. This has led to the evolution of more modern security models, such as [Zero Trust](Zero Trust Architecture.md), which emphasize continuous verification and assume that threats can exist both inside and outside the network.

## Modern context

Nowadays, while the Castle and Moat model is still relevant for certain aspects of cybersecurity, organizations are increasingly adopting more comprehensive security strategies that address both external and internal threats.

The [Zero-Trust model](Zero Trust Architecture.md) is often seen as a more robust alternative to the Castle and Moat approach, as it requires verification for every access request, regardless of whether it originates from inside or outside the network perimeter.
