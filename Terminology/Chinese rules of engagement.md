# Chinese Rules of Engagement

**Definition**: _Chinese Rules of Engagement (ROE)_ refer to the formal or informal guidelines that dictate when and how Chinese military forces can use force during conflicts or operations. These rules are shaped by China’s strategic doctrine, political objectives, and considerations of sovereignty, deterrence, and escalation control.

**Context/Example**: In military exercises or border incidents, Chinese forces follow ROE that prioritize minimizing escalation while achieving objectives. For example, during encounters in the South China Sea, the Chinese navy may shadow foreign ships and issue warnings before using any kinetic force, reflecting a cautious, politically-informed engagement strategy.

**Related Concepts**: Military Doctrine, Escalation Control, Deterrence, Sovereignty, Strategic Policy, Rules of Engagement, People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
