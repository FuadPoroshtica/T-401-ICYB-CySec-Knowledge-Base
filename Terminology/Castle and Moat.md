# Castle and Moat

**Definition**: _Castle and Moat_ is a cybersecurity strategy that focuses on creating a strong, secure perimeter around a network (the "castle") while controlling and monitoring access through defenses (the "moat"). The goal is to protect internal assets by keeping threats outside the protected boundary.  

**Context/Example**: An organization may implement a castle and moat strategy using firewalls, network segmentation, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems to ensure that only authorized users can access internal systems, while keeping external attackers at bay.
