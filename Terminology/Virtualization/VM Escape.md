# VM Escape

**Term**: **VM Escape / Container Escape**

**Definition**: An attack where code running inside a VM or container breaks out of its isolation and gains control of the host or other guests.

**Context/Example**: A malicious program inside a container exploits a kernel bug to get root on the host Linux system—this is the “holy grail” for virtualization attackers.

**Related Concepts**: [Hypervisor vulnerabilities](Hypervisor.md), kernel exploit, sandbox escape.
