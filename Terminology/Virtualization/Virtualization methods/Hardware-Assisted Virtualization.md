# Hardware-Assisted Virtualization

**Term**: Hardware-Assisted Virtualization (Intel VT-x, AMD-V)

**Definition**: CPU features that help the [hypervisor](../Hypervisor.md) run [VMs](../Virtual%20Machine%20(VM).md) faster and more securely by offloading low-level virtualization tasks to the processor.

**Context/Example**: Enabling “Intel VT-x” or “AMD-V” in BIOS/UEFI makes VMs run close to native speed instead of emulating privileged instructions in software.

**Related Concepts**: [Full virtualization](Full%20Virtualization.md), CPU privilege rings, performance overhead.
