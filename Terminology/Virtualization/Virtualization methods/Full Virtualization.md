# Full Virtualization

**Term**: Full Virtualization

**Definition**: A virtualization method where the [hypervisor](<../Hypervisor.md>) fully simulates the hardware so the guest OS doesn’t need to know it’s virtualized.

**Context/Example**: Running an unmodified Windows ISO in VirtualBox; Windows thinks it owns real hardware, but it’s actually talking to virtual devices.

**Related Concepts**: [Hardware-assisted virtualization](Hardware-Assisted Virtualization.md), [paravirtualization](<./Paravirtualization.md>), Type 1/Type 2 [hypervisors](<../Hypervisor.md>).
