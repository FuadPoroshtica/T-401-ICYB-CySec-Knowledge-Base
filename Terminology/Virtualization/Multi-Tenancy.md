# Multi-Tenancy

**Term**: **Multi-Tenancy**

**Definition**: A model where many independent users (tenants) share the same physical infrastructure, but their workloads should remain isolated.

**Context/Example**: In public clouds, different customers’ [VMs](Virtual%20Machine%20(VM).md) run on the same [hypervisors](Hypervisor.md); strong isolation is critical so one customer can’t access another’s data.

**Related Concepts**: [Hypervisor](Hypervisor.md) isolation, [VM escape](VM%20Escape.md), cloud security, [side-channel attacks](Side-Channel%20Attack.md).
