# Orchestration

**Term**: Orchestration (*for [containers](../Virtualization%20methods/Container.md))*

**Definition**: Automated management of many [containers](../Virtualization%20methods/Container.md) across multiple machines; handling scheduling, scaling, health checks, and networking.

**Context/Example**: Kubernetes automatically places [containers](../Virtualization%20methods/Container.md) on nodes, restarts them if they die, and handles internal service discovery. Misconfigurations here can create security holes.

**Related Concepts:** Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, service mesh, automation
