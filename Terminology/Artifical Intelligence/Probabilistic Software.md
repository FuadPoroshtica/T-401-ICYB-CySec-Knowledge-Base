# Probabilistic Software
- Generally, most software up to this point as been **deterministic**. You give it an input, it follows a specific set of rules, and for the same input you get the same output.
	- The inputs are rigid and specific. Like integers, Strings, etc.
	- The logic is very explicit and defined.
	- Security is therefore easier to determine whether it’s enough.
- But Generative AI is an example of **Probabilistic Software**; for the same input you might not get the same output.
	- Inputs are natural language, unstructured.
	- The logic is completely statistical.
	- So the security is much harder to define.
