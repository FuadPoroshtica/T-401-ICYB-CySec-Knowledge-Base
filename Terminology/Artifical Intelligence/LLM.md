# LLM

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of data. These models are trained on diverse datasets, allowing them to learn the nuances of language, context, and meaning. LLMs can perform a variety of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering.

They are built using deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, which enable them to process and generate text efficiently.

Examples of LLMs include OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s BERT, and Meta’s LLaMA.
