Their role includes promoting pro-government narratives, distracting from criticism, and shaping online discussions.

**Context/Example**: During online debates involving sensitive political topics, coordinated accounts appear in comment sections posting supportive messages, flooding threads with unrelated positivity, or steering conversations away from criticism. These activities are designed to create the impression of widespread public agreement or to obscure dissent.
