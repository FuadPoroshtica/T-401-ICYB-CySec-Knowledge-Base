# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

**Definition**: *Intrusion Detection System (IDS)* is a security technology that monitors network traffic or system activities for suspicious behavior or policy violations. IDS can alert administrators of potential threats or attacks, helping to detect unauthorized access or malicious activity.

**Context/Example**: A company may deploy an IDS to monitor incoming network traffic for patterns that match known malware signatures or unusual activity, such as repeated failed login attempts. When a potential intrusion is detected, the system generates alerts for security personnel to investigate.
