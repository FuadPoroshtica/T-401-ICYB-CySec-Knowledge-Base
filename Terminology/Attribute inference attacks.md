# Attribute Inference Attack

**Definition**: An *attribute inference attack* aims to infer unknown or sensitive attributes of individuals in a dataset using the outputs of a machine learning model and partial knowledge of their other attributes.

**Context/Example**: Even if a model does not explicitly use “medical condition” as an input, an attacker who knows a user’s age, location, and habits may use the model’s predictions to infer whether the user likely has a certain condition.
