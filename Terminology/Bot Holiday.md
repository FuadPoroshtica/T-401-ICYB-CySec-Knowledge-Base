# Bot Holiday

**Definition**: *Bot Holiday* refers to a temporary reduction in automated social media activity on a particular topic, often as bots shift focus to a different current event or narrative. It does not mean bots stop working entirely, but their disinformation efforts are temporarily redirected. The term was observed by analyst Joel Finkelstein while tracking online campaigns.

**Context/Example**: During the early days of the Russia–Ukraine conflict in 2022, analysts noticed a sharp decline in COVID-19 disinformation spread by automated accounts. The bots appeared to pause activity on pandemic-related topics and instead amplified narratives about the Ukraine invasion, creating a temporary lull in one area of misinformation.

**Related Concepts**: Information Warfare, Disinformation, Social Media Manipulation, Automated Propaganda, Narrative Saturation, PsyOps
