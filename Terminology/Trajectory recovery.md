# Trajectory recovery
**Definition**: _Trajectory recovery_ is a type of privacy attack where an adversary reconstructs a person’s movement path (trajectory) over time using partial, anonymized, or aggregated location data. Even when direct identifiers are removed, patterns in the data can reveal where someone has been.

**Context/Example**: A dataset of “anonymous” GPS pings from a city’s transportation app is released for research. An attacker cross-references the time and location patterns with public information (like home or workplace locations) and reconstructs an individual’s daily travel route—identifying where they live, work, and their habits.

**Related Concepts**: Location Privacy, Re-identification Attacks, Mobility Data, [K-anonymity](K-anonymity.md), [Differential Privacy](Differential%20Privacy.md), Spatiotemporal Data, Deanonymization
