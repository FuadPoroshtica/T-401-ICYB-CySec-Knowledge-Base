# Defense in Depth

**Definition**: *Defense in Depth* is a cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls and measures to protect systems, networks, and data. The goal is to provide redundancy so that if one layer fails, others continue to provide protection.

**Context/Example**: An organization may implement defense in depth by combining [Firewalls](Defense & Control/Firewall.md), intrusion detection systems, encryption, strong authentication, regular software updates, and employee security training. If a [Phishing](<./Attacks/Phishing.md>) attack bypasses email filters, other layers like endpoint protection and multi-factor authentication help prevent a breach.
