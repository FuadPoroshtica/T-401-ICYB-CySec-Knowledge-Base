# SLA (Service Level Agreement)

**Definition**: _Service Level Agreement (SLA)_ is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service, including performance metrics, responsibilities, and remedies in case of service failures.  

**Context/Example**: A cloud hosting company may include an SLA guaranteeing 99.9% uptime for its servers. If the service falls below this threshold, the SLA may require the provider to offer credits or compensation to affected customers.
