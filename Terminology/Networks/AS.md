# AS

An **Autonomous System (AS)** is a collection of [IP](TCP IP Model/IP.md) networks and [routers](Network hardware/Router.md) under the control of a single organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet.

Each AS is assigned a unique identifier known as an Autonomous System Number (ASN), which is used for routing decisions in the [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](<./BGP.md>).

Autonomous Systems are essential for the functioning of the internet, as they facilitate the exchange of routing information between different networks.
