# AS
**AS** stands for **Autonomous System**. An Autonomous System is a collection of [IP](TCP%20IP%20Model/IP.md) networks and [routers](Network%20hardware/Router.md) under the control of a single organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet.

Each AS is assigned a unique identifier known as an Autonomous System Number (ASN), which is used for routing decisions in the [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](BGP.md).
Autonomous Systems are essential for the functioning of the internet, as they facilitate the exchange of routing information between different networks.
