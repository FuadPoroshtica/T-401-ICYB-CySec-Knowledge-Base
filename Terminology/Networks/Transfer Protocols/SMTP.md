# SMTP
**SMTP** stands for **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**. It is a protocol used for sending and receiving email messages over the internet. SMTP operates on the [Application Layer](../OSI Model/7-Application Layer.md) of the [OSI Model](../OSI Model/OSI Model.md).
SMTP is responsible for the transmission of email messages from a sender’s email client to the recipient’s email server. It uses a set of commands and responses to facilitate the transfer of email messages between servers.

SMTP typically uses [Port](../../Systems & Plaforms/Port.md) 25 for communication, although other [ports](../../Systems & Plaforms/Port.md) such as 587 and 465 are also used for secure email transmission.

SMTP works in conjunction with other protocols, such as POP3 and IMAP, which are used for retrieving email messages from the recipient’s email server.

SMTP supports various features, including email forwarding, relaying, and authentication. It allows for the inclusion of attachments and supports different email formats, such as plain text and HTML.

SMTP is widely used for email communication and is supported by most email clients and servers. It is a crucial component of the modern email infrastructure, enabling the reliable delivery of email messages across the internet.
