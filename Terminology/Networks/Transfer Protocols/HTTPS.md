# HTTPS
**HTTPS** stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**. It is an extension of the standard [HTTP](<./HTTP.md>) protocol that adds a layer of security by using encryption to protect data transmitted between a web server and a web browser. HTTPS operates on the [Application Layer](../OSI Model/7-Application Layer.md) of the [OSI Model](../OSI Model/OSI Model.md).
HTTPS uses the [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](<../TLS.md>) protocol (or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)) to encrypt data exchanged between the client and server. This encryption helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data being transmitted.

When a user accesses a website using HTTPS, the web browser establishes a secure connection with the web server through a process called the [TLS](<../TLS.md>) handshake. During this process, the server presents a digital certificate to the client, which verifies the server’s identity and establishes encryption parameters for the session.

HTTPS is commonly used for secure online transactions, such as online banking, e-commerce, and any situation where sensitive information, such as login credentials or payment details, is exchanged. Websites that use HTTPS are indicated by a padlock icon in the browser’s address bar, and the URL begins with “https://” instead of “http://”.

Overall, HTTPS is a crucial component of modern web security, providing users with a secure and trustworthy browsing experience.
