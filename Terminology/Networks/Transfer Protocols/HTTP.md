# HTTP
**HTTP** stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**. It is an [Application Layer](../OSI%20Model/7-Application%20Layer.md) protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, over the internet.
HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
HTTP operates as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. The client, typically a web browser, sends an HTTP request to the server, which then processes the request and returns an HTTP response containing the requested resource or an error message.

HTTP supports various methods for different types of requests, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. Each method serves a specific purpose in the communication between the client and server.
HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is independent and does not retain any information about previous requests.

To maintain stateful interactions, mechanisms such as cookies and sessions are often used in conjunction with HTTP.

HTTP has evolved over time, with the most widely used versions being HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. HTTP/3, which is based on the QUIC transport protocol, is the latest version and offers improved performance and security features.

HTTP is commonly used for accessing web pages, APIs, and other web-based services. It is a crucial component of the modern internet, enabling the seamless exchange of information between clients and servers.
