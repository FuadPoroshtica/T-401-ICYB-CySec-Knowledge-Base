# A Network Hub
- They are largely obsolete, replaced by network switches.
- Hubs are simple connection devices.
- They broadcast incoming data to all connected devices.
- (They operate at the [Physical Layer](../OSI Model/1-Physical Layer.md) (Layer 1) of the [OSI Model](../OSI Model/OSI Model.md).)
- Also called an “Ethernet Hub”, used to connect multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment.
- If a signal is induced at any input, every output is open, except the original.

A [Switch](Switch.md) looks the same as a hub.
