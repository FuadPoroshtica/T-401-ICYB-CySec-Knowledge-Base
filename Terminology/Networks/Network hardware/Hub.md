# A Network Hub
- They are largely obsolete, replaced by network switches.
- Hubs are simple connection devices.
- They broadcast incoming data to all connected devices.
- (They operate at the [Physical Layer](../OSI%20Model/1-Physical%20Layer.md) (Layer 1) of the [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md).)

A [Switch](Switch.md) looks the same as a hub.
