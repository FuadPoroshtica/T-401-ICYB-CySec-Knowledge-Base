# A Network Switch
- More intelligent than a [Hub](Hub.md).
- It knows which devices are connected to which [ports](../../Systems & Plaforms/Port).
- It forwards data only to the intended recipient device.
- Unmanaged switches are plug-and-play.
- Managed switches offer advanced features like VLANs (Virtual Local Networks), QoS (Quality-of-Service), and network monitoring. They can be controlled and customized via software.
- Handles a Local Area Network (LAN).
- (Operates at the [Data Link Layer](../OSI%20Model/2-Data%20Link%20Layer.md) (Layer 2) of the [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md).)
