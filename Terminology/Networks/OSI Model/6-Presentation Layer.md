# 6-Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is the sixth layer in the [OSI Model](OSI Model.md) of computer networking. It is responsible for translating, encrypting, and compressing data between the [Application Layer](7-Application Layer.md) and the lower layers of the [OSI Model](OSI Model.md).

The Presentation Layer ensures that data is presented in a format that is understandable by the receiving application. It handles data translation between different character encoding schemes, such as ASCII and EBCDIC, and manages data serialization for complex data structures.

The Presentation Layer also provides data encryption and decryption services to ensure secure communication between devices. It can also perform data compression to reduce the size of data being transmitted, improving network efficiency.

The Presentation Layer works closely with the [Session Layer](5-Session Layer.md) to provide a seamless data exchange experience for applications.
