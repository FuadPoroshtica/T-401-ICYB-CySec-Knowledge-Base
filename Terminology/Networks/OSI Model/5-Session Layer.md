# 5-Session Layer

The **Session Layer** is the fifth layer in the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) of computer networking. It is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications on different devices.

The Session Layer provides mechanisms for opening, closing, and managing sessions, which are continuous exchanges of information between two or more devices. It ensures that sessions are maintained and synchronized, allowing for efficient communication between applications.

The Session Layer also handles session checkpoints and recovery, allowing for the resumption of sessions in case of interruptions or failures.

The Session Layer works closely with the [Transport Layer](4-Transport%20Layer.md) to provide reliable data transfer services between end systems.
