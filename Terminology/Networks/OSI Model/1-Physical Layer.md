# Physical Layer
The **Physical Layer** is the first and lowest layer in the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) of computer networking. It is responsible for the physical connection between devices, including the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.

The Physical Layer defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of the physical connection, including voltage levels, timing, data rates, and connector types. It ensures that data is transmitted accurately and efficiently between devices at the hardware level.

The Physical Layer works closely with the [Data Link Layer](Data%20Link%20Layer.md) to provide reliable data transfer over the physical medium.
