# TCP IP Model
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is another widely used networking model, especially for the internet. It only uses these four layers:
1. Link Layer (combines OSI Layers 1 and 2)
2. Internet Layer (OSI Layer 3)
3. Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)
4. Application Layer (combines OSI Layers 5, 6, and 7)

Great lies in networking: “An application only needs to understand the Application Layer to communicate over a TCP/IP network.”
