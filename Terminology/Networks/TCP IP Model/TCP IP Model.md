# TCP IP Model

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is another widely used networking model, especially for the internet. It only uses these four layers:

1. Link Layer (combines OSI Layers [1-Physical Layer](../OSI%20Model/1-Physical%20Layer.md) and [2-Data Link Layer](../OSI%20Model/2-Data%20Link%20Layer.md))
2. Internet Layer (OSI Layer [3-Network Layer](../OSI%20Model/3-Network%20Layer.md))
3. Transport Layer (OSI Layer [4-Transport Layer](../OSI%20Model/4-Transport%20Layer.md))
4. Application Layer (combines OSI Layers [5-Session Layer](../OSI%20Model/5-Session%20Layer.md), [6-Presentation Layer](../OSI%20Model/6-Presentation%20Layer.md), and [7-Application Layer](../OSI%20Model/7-Application%20Layer.md))

Great lies in networking: “An application only needs to understand the Application Layer to communicate over a TCP/IP network.”
