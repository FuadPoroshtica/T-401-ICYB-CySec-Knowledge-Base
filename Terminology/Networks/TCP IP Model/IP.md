# IP
In the context of computer networking, **IP** stands for **Internet Protocol**.
It is a fundamental protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite that is responsible for addressing and routing data packets across networks.
IP assigns unique numerical addresses, known as IP addresses, to devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other.
There are two main versions of IP in use today: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
IP operates at the [Network Layer](../OSI%20Model/3-Network%20Layer.md) (Layer 3) of the [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md), which is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate [routers](../Network%20hardware/Router.md).

IP works in conjunction with other protocols, such as [TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)](TCP.md) and [UDP (User Datagram Protocol)](../UDP.md), to facilitate reliable and efficient data transmission over networks.
IP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it does not establish a dedicated end-to-end connection before transmitting data. Instead, data packets are sent independently and may take different paths to reach their destination.

IP addresses are typically represented in a dotted-decimal format for IPv4 (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) and in hexadecimal colon-separated format for IPv6 (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

IP plays a crucial role in the functioning of the internet and other computer networks, enabling devices to locate and communicate with each other across diverse and interconnected networks.
