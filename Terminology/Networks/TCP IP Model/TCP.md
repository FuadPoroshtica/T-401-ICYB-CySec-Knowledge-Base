# TCP
The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is one of the main protocols in the Internet Protocol Suite and is responsible for establishing a reliable connection between devices on a network.
TCP ensures that data is transmitted accurately and in the correct order by implementing error-checking mechanisms and flow control.
It is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning that a connection must be established between the sender and receiver before data can be transmitted.
TCP is commonly used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.
It operates at the [Transport Layer](../OSI%20Model/4-Transport%20Layer.md) (Layer 4) of the [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md), which is responsible for end-to-end communication and data flow control.

TCP works in conjunction with the [Internet Protocol (IP)](IP.md), which is responsible for routing data packets to their destination.
