# LAN
**LAN (Local Area Network)** is a network that connects computers within a limited area, like a home, school, or office building.
There are all kinds of technologies to connect things together, like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.

More details about a Local Area Network (LAN) in a home:

Typically, we have a home [Router](Network hardware/Router.md) that connects to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) via a modem.

The home [Router](Network hardware/Router.md) typically has a built-in [Switch](Network hardware/Switch.md) to connect multiple wired devices, and also provides Wi-Fi for wireless devices.

(A [Switch](Network hardware/Switch.md) is a device that connects multiple devices on a LAN and uses [MAC (Media Access Control)](MAC.md) addresses to forward data to the correct destination.)

And in reality, the internet itself is just a huge network of networks.
