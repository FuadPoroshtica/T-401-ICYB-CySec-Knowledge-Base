# DNS
**DNS (Domain Name System)** is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to translate human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into [IP](TCP IP Model/IP.md) addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to identify each other on the network. DNS is essential for the functioning of the internet, as it allows users to access websites and services using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical [IP](TCP IP Model/IP.md) addresses.

When a user types a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into its corresponding [IP](TCP IP Model/IP.md) address. The DNS server then responds with the [IP](TCP IP Model/IP.md) address, allowing the browser to connect to the appropriate web server and retrieve the requested content.

DNS operates using a distributed database system, with multiple DNS servers around the world that work together to provide fast and reliable name resolution.

DNS also supports various record types, such as:

- “A” records (which map domain names to IPv4 addresses),
- “AAAA” records (which map domain names to IPv6 addresses),
- “MX” records (which specify mail servers for a domain),
- and “CNAME” records (which create aliases for domain names).

Overall, DNS is a critical component of the internet infrastructure, enabling seamless navigation and communication across the web.
