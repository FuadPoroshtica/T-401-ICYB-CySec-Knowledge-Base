# MAC
In the context of computer networking, **MAC** stands for **Media Access Control**.
It is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.

MAC addresses are used in various network technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi, to ensure that data packets are delivered to the correct device on a local network.
MAC addresses play a crucial role in network security and management, as they can be used to control access to a network and monitor network traffic.

MAC addresses operate at the [Data Link Layer](OSI%20Model/2-Data%20Link%20Layer.md) (Layer 2) of the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md), which is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection.

A MAC address is typically represented as a series of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
Each network interface card (NIC) is assigned a unique MAC address by the manufacturer, which helps in identifying devices on a network.
