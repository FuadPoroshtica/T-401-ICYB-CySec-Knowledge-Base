# Port

**Term**: Port (*network port*)

**Definition**: A logical endpoint number on a machine that identifies a specific network service (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

**Context/Example**: A “secure machine” is described as having “all ports closed”; that means no services are listening, severely reducing the ways an attacker can connect.

**Related Concepts**: TCP/UDP, socket, service, [Firewall](../Defense%20&%20Control/Firewall.md) rules
