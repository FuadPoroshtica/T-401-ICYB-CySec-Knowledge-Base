# Kernel
**Definition**: The **Kernel** is the core component of an [Operating System](Operating System.md) that manages system resources and facilitates communication between hardware and software. It operates at a low level, directly interacting with the computer’s hardware to control processes, memory, and device management.

**Context/Example**: In a typical computer system, the kernel is responsible for tasks such as process scheduling, memory management, and handling input/output operations. For example, when a user launches an application, the kernel allocates the necessary resources and manages the execution of that application.

**Related Concepts**: Privileged Mode, Restricted mode, System Calls
