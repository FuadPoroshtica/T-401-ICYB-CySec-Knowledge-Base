# Operating System

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling users to interact with the system without needing to understand the complexities of the hardware.

Operating systems perform several key functions, including:

- **Resource Management**: Allocating and managing hardware resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and peripheral devices.
- **File Management**: Organizing, storing, retrieving, and managing data on storage devices.
- **Process Management**: Handling the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes (running programs).
- **User Interface**: Providing a user interface, which can be command-line based or graphical, to facilitate user interaction with the system.
- **Security and [Access Control](../Defense & Control/Access Control.md)**: Protecting system resources and data from unauthorized access.
- **Networking**: Managing network connections and communication between devices.
- **Device Management**: Controlling and coordinating the use of hardware devices through device drivers.
- **System Performance Monitoring**: Tracking system performance and resource usage to optimize efficiency.
- **Error Detection and Handling**: Identifying and managing errors in hardware and software to ensure system stability.
- Providing a platform for application software to run.

## Common types of operating systems include:
- **Desktop Operating Systems**: Such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, designed for personal computers.
- **Mobile Operating Systems**: Such as Android and iOS, designed for smartphones and tablets.
- **Server Operating Systems**: Such as Windows Server, Linux Server distributions (e.g., Ubuntu Server, CentOS), and UNIX, designed to manage server hardware and provide services to client machines.
- **Embedded Operating Systems**: Such as FreeRTOS and VxWorks, designed for embedded systems in devices like [routers](../Networks/Network hardware/Router.md), appliances, and automotive systems.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**: Such as QNX and RTLinux, designed for applications that require precise timing and high reliability.

## Cyber Security Context

In the context of cyber security, operating systems play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems. They implement various security measures, such as user authentication, [Access Controls](../Defense & Control/Access Control.md), encryption, and system monitoring, to protect against unauthorized access, [Malware](<../Attacks/Malware/Malware.md>), and other cyber threats. Understanding the operating system is essential for identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security policies, and ensuring the overall security posture of an organization’s IT infrastructure.

Operating systems are a fundamental component of modern computing, and their design and functionality significantly impact the performance, usability, and security of computer systems.

## Kernel vs Operating System

The difference between an Operating System and a kernel is that the [Kernel](<./Kernel.md>) is the core component of the operating system that directly interacts with the hardware, while the operating system encompasses the [Kernel](<./Kernel.md>) along with additional software and services that provide a complete user experience and system management capabilities.
