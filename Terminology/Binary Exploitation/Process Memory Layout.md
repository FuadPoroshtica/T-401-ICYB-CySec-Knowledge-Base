# Process Memory Layout
A simple view looks like this (from top to bottom):
0. **Kernel Space** (not directly accessible)
1. **Stack**: At the top, you have the <font color="#00b0f0">stack</font>, which *grows downwards*↓.
2. **Heap**: A region called the heap, used for dynamically allocated memory like `malloc`.
3. **.bss / .data**: Here we have global variables and static data.
4. **.text**: At the bottom, you have the program’s code section, where the machine instructions live.

We care most about the <font color="#00b0f0">stack</font>.
Whenever a function is called, some important things are placed on the <font color="#00b0f0">stack</font>:
1. The **<font color="#C868CA">return address</font>** – this is the address of the instruction where the program should continue after the function finishes.
2. The **saved base pointer (the saved `RBP`)**, which helps the function keep track of its local variables.
3. The **local variables** themselves, like small arrays or integers.
