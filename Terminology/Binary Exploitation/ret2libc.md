# ret2libc
## 9. ret2libc
**ret2libc** = “return to libc”: instead of jumping to your own shellcode, you reuse functions in the C standard library (`libc`), like `system`, `printf`, `execve`, etc.
Basic steps in a typical ret2libc exploit:
1. **Find or leak a libc address** at runtime (e.g., via `puts` a GOT entry).
2. Use that to determine the base address of `libc` in memory.
3. Compute addresses of `system` and `"/bin/sh"` inside that libc.
4. Build a [ROP](Return%20Oriented%20Programming%20(ROP).md) chain:
```
"A" * offset
+ pop_rdi_ret
+ address_of_string_bin_sh
+ address_of_system
```
The lecture just introduces **ret2libc + [ROP](Return%20Oriented%20Programming%20(ROP).md) as an exploit chain** you can use to get remote code execution by sending a single malicious payload.
