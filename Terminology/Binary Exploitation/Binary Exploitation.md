# Binary Exploitation

Binary exploitation is about abusing bugs in compiled programs to make them do things they were not meant to do.

Most of the time, this happens in low-level languages like C or C++, where the programmer has to manage memory manually.

Common problems include:

- Writing past the end of a buffer,
- Using memory that has already been freed,
- Or leaving memory uninitialized.
Attackers use these bugs to:
- Crash programs,
- Read sensitive data,
- Or, most importantly, **change the program’s control flow** so they can run their own code or gain higher privileges.

Even today, a huge chunk of serious vulnerabilities are memory safety bugs in C/C++ code, especially in low-level or high-performance systems ([OS](Operating System.md) kernels, browsers, network daemons, etc.).

Mitigations (like ASLR, stack canaries, NX, etc.) exist, but they’re not perfect, so exploitation techniques keep evolving ([ROP](Return Oriented Programming (ROP).md), [ret2libc](<./ret2libc.md>), heap exploitation, etc.).
