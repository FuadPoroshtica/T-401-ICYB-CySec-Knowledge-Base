Our collaborative project for the CySec Knowledge Base was a high-speed effort, requiring quick adaptation.

### Chosen Tool

We initially aimed to use **Notion** because we felt its visual organization tools would be ideal for structuring the complex topics in the course. However, when we ran into issues securing a student discount for Notion, we had to swiftly change our plan. Given the three-week time frame, we quickly switched to Obsidian and GitHub. This proved to be a practical decision, as Obsidian offered easy, real-time co-editing that everyone was already familiar with, removing any delays associated with learning a new platform. Discord served as our central hub for quick decisions and coordination.

### Organization Overview

We organized our information to be maximally efficient for exam lookup, dividing the course content into major, easy-to-navigate sections. We structured the document to follow the flow of the material, moving from foundational principles to system security, and then to advanced, modern threats.

The structure ensured that concepts such as the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and **Defense in Depth** were defined clearly at the beginning. We then built upon this foundation by dedicating separate sections to highly technical areas like **Operating System Mechanics** (Kernel/User Space, Auditing) and **Network Protocols** (IP, TCP/UDP, BGP). Finally, we grouped the modern and non-technical risks, including **Web Vulnerabilities** (XSS, SQLi) , **AI Security Threats** (Prompt Injection) , and **Operational Security (OPSEC)**. We made sure to clarify core ideas, such as always checking for authorization in **IDOR** vulnerabilities and using prepared statements for **SQLi**.

### Collaborative Process Reflection

Our three-week schedule presented significant time constraints, which required strict discipline and coordination.

**What Worked Well:**

- **Adaptability:** The decision to quickly switch from Notion to Obsidian minimized downtime and ensured all members could contribute immediately without a steep learning curve.
   
- **Continuous Feedback:** We relied heavily on Discord for rapid checks and clarifications. If one member encountered confusing terminology or inconsistent information across different lecture sources (e.g., confirming the correct mitigation for a specific vulnerability), a quick question on Discord ensured everyone stayed aligned.
 
**Challenges and How We Overcame Them:**

- **Information Volume and Consistency:** The sheer amount of information, especially specific command syntax and complex acronyms (like ASLR, DEP/NX, BGP, POSIX), was difficult to manage. We overcame this by dedicating time after every major lecture block to a final review session. During this session, we cross-referenced all notes against the original slides to verify key definitions and tool usage, ensuring high accuracy.
    
- **Synthesizing Overlapping Concepts:** Many core principles, such as **Least Privilege** and **Defense in Depth**, appeared in the context of Operating Systems, Networks, and Web Security. To avoid repetition, we decided to define these fundamental concepts once in a core section and simply reference them when discussing their technical implementation (e.g., discussing SUID as an enforcement of Least Privilege).
