**The lab today:**
- We’ll have to solve roughly 10 of the 10-point challenges to get full points.
	- We need 100 points in total?
- There are solutions for these labs online, but again they want us to learn.
- There are *hints* in the website itself, and they’re supposed to be used.

# 2025-12-09 Information Warfare (Gísli)
A guest lecture from Jacky Mallett.
- Information Warfare (or “cognitive warfare” as it’s being rebranded at the moment).
- There’s only been recent awareness that this has been going on for quite a while.
- She shows various examples of troll bots/AIs from the Russians when they were interfering with the US elections.
	- She also shows an example of a MAGA influencer tweeting from the wrong account, trying to pretend to be an African American woman as a form of information warfare.
- John Buchan (1875-1940) worked for Wellington House, a British WWI propaganda bureau. There’s nothing *new* about propaganda.
- These days it can take many different forms of course. There are hundreds of Hollywood movies that are co-scripted with the US Department of Defence, they get money for military equipment while they have to make the US military to look like the good guys.
- Advertising is also another form of cognitive warfare. Around 50% of advertisements is actually payed by the government (“take the vaccine”, “do your taxes”, “don’t travel to $x$ country”, etc.)
- She talks about the important fact that while yes, the Russians have quite a lot of propaganda; the Americans have a lot as well.
- When Google made it so that if you get enough people to click a link, you can make money. And because of this, anyone can make money by being popular enough.
	- And instinctively, people have a *huge* confirmation bias. We tend to look for sensationalist news.
	- If nothing happened today, no one is going to pay attention to news headlines that say “nothing happened today”.
	- But if you’re a news company that *always* pretends that ***something*** is going on *all the time*, then you can make a lot more money.
- She talks about how the Chinese government employs people to control the conversation on forums online.
- **Troll Armies:**
	- Dedicated teams often for hire.
	- Manually (possibly with some automation):
    	- Flood Facebook and other forums.
    	- Flood newspaper comment sections.
    	- Leave one star reviews and similar
	- Also used by influencers for advertising
	- Almost mandatory now to have some form of moderation
- **Rent a Mob**
	- She points out a picture of a protest, but all the protest signs are the same. So there’s quite a lot of coordination. Helps to tell the difference between organised and disorganised protests.
- **Psychological Operations (PsyOps):**
	- Coordinated operations to influence emotions and objective reasoning.
		- Encourage dissent against leadership.
		- Pollute the information space.
			- Essentially initiate a human level broadcast storm.
			- Prevents any useful information getting through.
	- US Army 2nd, 4th, 7th and 8th Psychological Operations Groups.
- **Bot Holiday:**
	- After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started, the bot attacks suddenly stopped all at the same time across the internet.
- Life expectancy is, interestingly enough, something that’s very hard for governments to fiddle with, no matter how much they try. (maybe?)
- There’s a language school in China that trains 100 people to speak Icelandic every year?? This came up when a Chinese woman on Facebook was speaking very good Icelandic, and everyone was confused (many Europeans don’t even bother with Icelandic).
