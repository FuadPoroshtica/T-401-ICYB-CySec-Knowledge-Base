- In the exam, we *may* have access to CySec Knowledge Base, while in the exam, it will be in the DigiExam program.
- [VMs](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtual Machine (VM).md) make it easier to manage and use physical resources
- [VMs](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtual Machine (VM).md) are isolated and can run on a local device without affecting the host system
- Type 2 is like an application, and type 1 is like the whole machine.
- Running [Emulation](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtualization methods/Emulation.md) lets you run a [VM](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtual Machine (VM).md) on a different architecture.
- [Paravirtualization](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtualization methods/Paravirtualization.md) is a [virtualization](<../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtualization.md>) method in which the guest operating system is modified or uses special drivers to communicate directly with the [hypervisor](<../Terminology/Virtualization/Hypervisor.md>) for better performance.
- In [OS](Operating System.md)-based virtualization ([containers](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtualization methods/Container.md)), the primary purpose of “[orchestration](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtualization Hardening & Operations/Orchestration.md)” is to automate the management, deployment, scaling, and networking of [containerized](../Terminology/Virtualization/Virtualization methods/Container) applications.

- Security Challenges: [VM Escape](../Terminology/Virtualization/VM Escape.md), [Hypervisor](<../Terminology/Virtualization/Hypervisor.md>) as target
